Transcend your cultural escape by questioning the rules of society.

Selectively choose the rules you want to follow.

Practice consciousness engineering (requires one to understand that personal growth depends on ones ability to carefully choose and frequent updates) and create self encouraging models of reality.

Upgrade system for living (3 step approach)
discovering- acquire new skill or ability,
 refreshing-  upgrade what you already know and 
measuring -  measure your effectiveness 

Ensure you are happy in present while being focussed on goals.

Practice discipline of regular and prolonged happiness, gratitude (cherish your success from past, be greatful for what you have).

Craft a vision; Do not confuse with means goals defined by society; Develop goals that bring you joy that have nothing to do society.

Have goals that are  self fueled. You shouldn't depend on or be influenced by external forces. These are the goals for which success or failure will only influence and no body else.
Understand you can't control actions of others so don't let others action define how you feel or what your life look like.

Find your calling that motivates you to bring positive change in the world.
