Reaching orgasm:

First, adjust the angle of penetration so that the tip of the penis touches the woman’s G-spot. Second, alter the pressure so that the man’s pelvic bone is in contact with the woman’s clitoris.

So, in the missionary position, a pillow should be placed under the woman’s lower back to help elevate her hips, and then the man should keep his hips as close as possible to the woman’s hips by kneeling. For pressure, Hartley suggests that the man slowly moves his hips in small circular motions or side to side to make sure that his pelvic bone is hitting the clitoris.

Increasing Libido for female:
To increase your testosterone or LH levels in the short-term, the same advice applies: you should eat at least 800 mg of cholesterol (four hard-boiled eggs, for example) a few hours before bed, one night before you want to have sex. This is because both testosterone and LH are made from cholesterol, which is produced most efficiently during the night.
