Women desire has never been respected.

Because women will conceive anyways their pleasure has been taken forgranted.

The parental investment theory states; Because  women have limited eggs as opposed to men who have infinite number of sperms, it is assume to be the reason why women desire security in relationships.

Women have always been told how to act and behave

Strangely women don't know this but majority of the women themselves are more reactive thoughts and audio/visual interpretation of sex.

Women are less likely to admit they want sex or masturbate than men.

Being desired is central to women's libido.

When a women looses sexual desire, it is more of psychological than physical. Give her the attention and make her center of your world and she will be back to being happy herself.
