The law of least effort suggests we tend to use minimum amount of energy for each tasks.

System 1 takes less energy it is often our first instinct to use it than system 2 which takes more energy.

Avoiding to use System 2 limits our intelligence from being strengthened 

Example: 

In the bat and ball problem the two items costs 1.10 cents and we would believe that because bat costs 1$ more than ball, ball cost is 10 cents but here we are not considering the aspect that there could be other costs involved that have not been included.

Practicing focus and self control helps improve our intelligence
