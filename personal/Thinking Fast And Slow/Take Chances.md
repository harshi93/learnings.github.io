The way we judge ideas and approach problem is heavily determined by the way they are expressed to us 

For e.g 
On being told a fact about drug being administered 
In way similar to statement 1
Only 0.001% children have chance of disfigurement 
People were fine administering the drug 

Though making the same statement in way similar to statement 2
1 in 100,000 children have a chance of disfigurement 
People were twice less likely to get their children administered with drug
