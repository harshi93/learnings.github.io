Research shows that sometimes our actions are not in control of conscious mind but rather are a result of priming due to social and cultural situations 

Example:

A person grown in the society primed with the idea of money, act more independently and are less willing to involved with, depend on or accept demands from others, people from such society are more likely demonstrate less or zero altruism.

Priming can affect individual thoughts, choices, judgement and behavior.
