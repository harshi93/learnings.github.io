Experience self:
- Asks question how we feel now
- Gives more accurate account 

Remember self:
- Asks questions how was it on the whole 
- Less accurate, register memory after events unfolded, dominates 
- Reasons why remembering self dominates 
	- Duration neglect - we ignore total duration of event in favor of certain memory
	- Peak end rule - over emphasize on what occurs at the end of the event
- A research involving patients going through colonoscopy.
	- Were asked how they felt during the procedure while participants from short and long procedures reported they felt the same 
	- At the end of procedure when asked the same question, participants from shorter procedure with increasing pain towards the end said they felt worse.
	- Reason being remembering self dominates the experiencing self.
