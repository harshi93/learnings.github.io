We can control and predict much less than we think in life.

Have you ever thought about why people at casinos throw their dice harder if they want a high number, and gently if they need a low one to win big?

These gamblers are suffering from the illusion of control – i.e., the belief that we can influence things that we in fact cannot control.

The illusion of control offers us hope: if we believe that we can exert some kind of control over our situation, then we can better endure life’s many sufferings.

It’s therefore in your best interest to be critical of predictions and to focus your energy on a few things of importance that you truly can influence.
