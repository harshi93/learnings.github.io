You can’t control your feelings, but you can always control your actions.

Athletes know that feelings are only suggestions and sometimes it’s best to ignore those suggestions, especially when you’re trying to reach a goal.

According to neuroscientist Antonio Damasio our emotions are the deciding factor for 95 percent of our decisions. So rather than “thinking and acting,” we generally “feel and act.”

Part of Damasio’s research involved brain-damaged people who were unable to experience emotions. Even though they could list the pros and cons of any given choice, they were unable to make decisions

Instead of letting fears and worries stop you from fulfilling your dreams in life, catch yourself and take five seconds to make the decision that brings you closer to your goal.

This is what’s known as psychological intervention.

Aristotle, who summed it up as: “Do good, be good.” In other words, you have to change your behavior before you can change how you feel about yourself. The five-second rule is such a useful tool because it’s focused on doing just that. It changes your behavior and provides you with the courage to overcome the psychological obstacles that stand in your way.
