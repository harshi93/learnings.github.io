Heisenberg's uncertainty principle posits, how it’s only possible to either know where an electron currently is or know its path and speed. At a given point It’s only possible to know both its position and its path. All this means is that you can’t really predict where an electron will be; you can only guess its probability of being somewhere

Quantum theory is tricky to understand, but it helps explain very small entities. It can’t be used to explain the big things in the universe – things like gravity and time. 

the theory of relativity is great for understanding the larger forces in the universe. It’s hopeless, however, at explaining the subatomic world.
