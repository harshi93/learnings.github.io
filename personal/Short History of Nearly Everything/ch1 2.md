98% percent of all matter, along with the fundamental forces that govern the universe, were created in the time it takes you to make a sandwich.

Just detune your TV, and listen for that weird static you get between stations. Around 1 percent of this static is a remnant from the big bang – a relic of our universe’s earliest moments.
