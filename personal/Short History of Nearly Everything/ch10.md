there are about one trillion bacteria living on your skin right now – and that’s if you’re healthy! 

There are so many bacteria on Earth that if we added up the mass of all living things on the planet, tiny bacteria would account for 80 percent of that total

Bacteria can produce a new generation in less than ten minutes. 

without outside influences, a single bacterium could theoretically produce more offspring in two days than there are protons in the universe!

Bacteria can live and thrive on almost anything with little moisture.  

Bacteria can even live in the waste tanks of nuclear reactors. 

when a bacterium’s DNA is blasted with radiation, it will simply reform as if nothing has happened.

Among other vital roles, bacteria recycle our waste, purify water, and keep the soil productive. They convert our food into useful vitamins and sugars, and they allow us to process and use the nitrogen in the air.

All in all, most bacteria are either neutral or beneficial for humans. 

About 1 in 1000 bacteria is pathogenic. This tiny demographic represents the third-most lethal killer of humans worldwide.
