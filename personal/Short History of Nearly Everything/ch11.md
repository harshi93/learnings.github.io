Estimates range from 3 million to 200 million species

According to one report in the Economist, up to 97 percent of the world’s plant and animal species remain undiscovered. 

99.9 percent of the DNA code between two completely random people  happens to be exactly the same. 

Approximately 50% of your DNA would match up perfectly with the DNA of a banana. 

60% of your genes are exactly the same as those found in the fruit fly, and at least 90 percent of them correlate on some level with those found in mice.

scientists have discovered that parts of our DNA are interchangeable between species. For example, we can insert human DNA into certain cells of flies, and they will “accept” this DNA as if it were their own.
