You could measure the strength of a person's spirit based upon how much undiluted truth they can tolerate.

Our ability to fool ourselves into thinking we already know everything we need to know. This is an especially foolish perspective to have, since it shuts off our natural desire to learn and grow

Stop lying and be truthful.

You don’t need to give up each one of your ambitious goals, but you should be flexible so that your goals are realistic and reflect the truth. 

If your life is off track, it might be time to challenge the current truth you’re following, the one that has you feeling weak, rejected or worthless, and reaffirm your personal truth so that you can get back on the right track.
