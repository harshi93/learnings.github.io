Conversations are an opportunity to learn and grow, not compete.

One big reason why people talk to each other, so that they can more easily present the two sides of an issue and come to a conclusion. 
    - For example: if one kid thinks it would be fun to play up on a roof, they might suggest this idea to a friend who then points out the dangers of this idea. The conversation that ensues allows the child with the original idea to take in the new perspective, consider how likely it is that someone will fall and hurt themselves, and hopefully make the right decision.
    - listen to what others have to say, while presuming you have something to learn from them.

An easy tip for being a better conversationalist is 
    - to listen and then summarize, 
    - or recap out loud what the other person just said. 

This serves multiple purposes: 
    - it helps assure that you’ve heard things correctly, 
    - while also helping it stick in your memory; 
    - it also reduces the likelihood of distorting or oversimplifying details in order to suit your side of the conversation.

Sometimes the truth hurts, and it’s painful to take in information that means you have to change your ideas and preconceptions. But this is the price you pay as part of the beautiful process of learning and growing.
