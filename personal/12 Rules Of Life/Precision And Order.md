We tend only to recognize or pay attention to the things that are either useful to us or stand in our way. 

It's extremely important to use precise language

When things get complex and chaotic, so in order to recover, you must reestablish order by clearly and precisely explaining what went wrong.

By being precise, you can restore order and take steps to start feeling better.

Precise language can make your relationships run more smoothly as well. 

The sooner youâ€™re honest and precise, the easier life will be.
