it’s important to recognize that the dark bits of pain, suffering and sorrow are what give the good moments their value.

Make the best out of even the smallest joys that life offers.

By following this rule, you’ll be sure to embrace life and appreciate every good thing that comes your way. You’ll also be sure to see yourself through the tough times, even when they’re prolonged.

There is no day without the darkness of night, just as there’s no order without chaos. There is suffering in life, but it’s also what gives meaning to our perseverance and makes the moments of peace so rewarding.
