Hierarchy among chicken shows
1. The healthiest, strongest ones that always got to peck first when the chicken feed came. 
2. The weakest chickens, with their feathers falling out, only got to peck at the leftover crumbs.

Lobsters, for instance, whether theyâ€™re in the ocean or raised in captivity, will aggressively fight over the best and most secure spots for shelter.

Winners will have a higher ratio of the hormone serotonin to octopamine
1. More serotonin will lead to the winners being more agile and upright, and more octopamine makes losers tense
and curled up. 
2. The upright lobsters will appear bigger and more intimidating, causing the tense ones to remain submissive.


Those in the grips of alcoholism or depression are less likely to enter a competitive situation, which only reinforces more inactivity and continued low self-esteem and depression.

Conversely, those on a winning streak often present a swaggering and confident body language, which can help them keep their streak alive. 

Trying to give yourself an advantage, follow the first rule: hold your head high and strike the posture of a winner.
