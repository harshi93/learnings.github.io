At smallest Glimmer of information We Judge people we don't know

We need clear triggers to tip from suspicion to disbelief

Assuming truth is important for society to function 

What you see on peoples face doesn't tells the whole story. .

Talking to strangers starts with not making assumptions

Summary:
Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. 
We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. 
The result of this misplaced confidence ischemic we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.
