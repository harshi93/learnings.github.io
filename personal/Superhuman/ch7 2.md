Scientists now know that stem cells’ regenerative potential comes from their ability to differentiate into various kinds of cells, allowing them to renew and repair cells in a given area of the body.


As you get older, your stem cell reserves start to wane and the remaining cells begin to lose efficiency.


In an operation that currently costs thousands of US dollars, stem cell treatments harvest stem cells from your subcutaneous fat or bone marrow, processing the cells before reinjecting them into specific areas to promote healing. During the author’s first stem cell treatment in 2015, his doctor injected stem cells into his shoulder and upper back, which he had injured as a teenager. He also injected stem cells into his face to tighten the collagen in his skin, and into his reproductive organs to increase blood flow and nerve endings.  He even noticed exceptional improvement in the quality of his sleep.

Though the author’s stem cell therapy was for the most part a preventative effort, he also gifted stem cells to his mother after she fell and cut her face with her glasses in her late sixties. Astonishingly, the treatment made what had been a very large scar barely visible.
