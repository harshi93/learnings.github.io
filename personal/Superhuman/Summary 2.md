Understanding mitochondrial efficiency is the key to making choices that foster longevity. You can age backwards and even reverse cellular damage by practicing a cyclical ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, and also by tracking your sleep quality and hormonal levels.

Actionable advice:

Gain ten years by aligning your jaw.

Most of us are used to dentists telling us what to do so that our teeth will look good. But what many dentists don’t realize is that a misaligned bite can trigger your trigeminal nerve to send a fight-or-flight signal to your body, causing a domino effect of inflammation and stress. To test your jaw alignment, relax your muscles with your mouth open and then slowly bite down. If your molars don’t hit evenly just before your front teeth touch, look into buying a bite guard from the drugstore or getting a custom one made by your dentist.
