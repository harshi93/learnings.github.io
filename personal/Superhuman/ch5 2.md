sleep is an essential component to becoming Super Human.

A good night’s rest regulates our hormones to help us feel satiated, improving cognitive abilities, promoting skin health, and encouraging healthy cell division.

one study conducted by the university of southern california’s keck school of medicine and the american cancer society found that adults over thirty that slept six and a half hours a night lived longer than people who slept eight. ultimately though, even more important than the quantity of sleep you get is the quality of that sleep. 

A perfect night’s rest maximizes your time in both REM sleep and deep sleep. REM stands for rapid eye movement, and it’s the kind of sleep in which you dream. During deep sleep, which is also called delta sleep, your breathing and heart rate drop and your brain waves slow down. Scientists believe that it’s deep sleep that turns short-term memories into long-term memories, reduces stress levels, and releases hormones for immune support.
