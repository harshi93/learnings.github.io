Begin with imitating your heroes and end by emulating their work, find your strength in someone else weakness.

Creativity and inspiration often come when you let your mind wander.

Side projects don’t even have to be creative in nature. 

When you get harassed or criticized, don’t let it bring you down and certainly don’t stop creating. Ignore the negativity, or turn your anger inward and let it inspire you.

If you can’t help getting angry, then at least find a constructive use for your anger. Anger can actually be a good thing if you can make it into a source of creativity.
