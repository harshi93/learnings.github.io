Australopithecus is great apes from where our history begins, they existed 2.5 mn years ago

We aka Homo sapiens came into existence 300,000 years ago

The interbreeding and The replacement theory are two theories associated with widespread existence of homosapiens and simultaneous extinction of Homo neanderthalensis who evolved after Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus fled to parts of europe from africa

The interbreeding theory suggests that we mated with neanderthals and evolved into sapiens

The replacement theory suggests that sapiens leveraged their evolved abilities and took everything from other species pushing them towards extinction

For the last 12,000 years ago homosapiens have been the only species representing humans 

The only last known human species known to exists alongside Homosapiens was  Homo floresiensis who existence dates back about 12,000 years ago 

Cognitive Revolution

The last known major leap in cognitive ability is 70,000 years ago. 

It is what taught us how build large complex/sophisticated relations, tools, techniques, establish trade networks.

Human Language

It is what allowed us to communicate and collaborate with each other, develop common understanding, form large communities.


Agriculture Revolution 

12,000 years ago homosapiens shifted from hunting/gathering to farming.

Homosapiens ability to grow their own food, is what to led population explosion

The ability to grow food to meet needs and demands of community led Development of economy of favors

This development also led to development of new trades like blacksmith and weaving and also development of barter trading systems(exchange of trades for food and goods). But because of lack of a binding agreement one couldn't hold a person accountable for borrowing, this system soon came to end.

Around 3000 BC

This is also the point when concepts of accounting and paper money were introduced, so that people could be held accountable for purchase and if they intended to buy something by paying it's price  upfront there was a currency consistent across the community that could be used by seller to buy stuff at later date preventing sellers from being forced to trade one thing for another even if the buyer had nothing of use to seller.

The sumerians of mesopotamia were the first to leverage clay tablets for accounting and barley money as currency


Around 1776 BC 

King Hammurabi of Babylonian Empire instated collection of laws focussed on tax, theft and murder.


Around this time 30 percent of males were victims of murder or manslaughter

Scientific Revolution:

In 16th and 17th Century, scientific revolution swept europe and people began to believe in their capability more than the fact that they had a predetermined fate dictated by god and everyone was just living to see that.

Columbus famous atlantic trip that discovered america was paid for by king of castile of europe 

Similarly Australia and New Zealand were result of discovery initiative backed by British Government and lead by James Cook

By 19th Century British Empire covered atleast around half of the globe 

Since 1945 no country has been conquered/eliminated by another country 

20th Century is the most peaceful century, 
only 1 percent of male is victim of manslaughter or murder. This is primarily possible because of hierarchy/structures and laws enforcement currently in place 

Psychologists have found that we are not exceeding our regular levels of happiness are not reaching new highs. At best we may see temporary spike but then we will eventually come back to our regular levels 


Scientists have found a way increase the lifespan of elegans worms and they are trying to do the same for mice 

Currently, Gilgamesh  Project is an ongoing attempt to find ways to make humans stop aging and integrated technology with organic human

Summary:
.For 300,000 years, Homo sapiens evolved from being just one of the many species of humans to becoming the most dominant species ever to walk the planet. Beginning with the development of language and common myths that tie our social fabrics together, human civilization has been getting more and more sophisticated â€“ leading to the interconnected global village we have today.
