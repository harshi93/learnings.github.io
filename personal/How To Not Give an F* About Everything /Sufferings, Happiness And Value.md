Sufferings, Happiness and Value

Sufferings can lead to happiness but it won't if we don't have right values 

Comparing your success against others and using that as a baseline definition of success and happiness is not going to scale well because someday someone better than you will rise. When such moment arrives you will be left sad and depressed and god knows for how long. Dave Mustaine from metallica and member and Peter Best from the Beattles were kicked but peter ended up being happy he realized happiness really meant to him  while dave struggled to find happiness because happiness to him was being better than metallica.
