Focus on present to improve your life.

Pain is nothing more than self created resistance against things that we cannot change.

You feel pain when you are unsatisfied with how things are yet don't feel powerful enough to bring change.

Ego is what leads to unhappiness.

Separate your mind from body; mind causes pain by bringing memories from the past or invoking worries about future, because you can't alter either of those.

Understand/Observe the power and influence mind has over your body and separate the two inorder to control minds power/influence.

Do not judge anything or anyone when you judge you are listening to mind because judging is an act of mind.

Try to be in a state of permanent alert or active waiting. This is state you enter when we are waiting for something crucial. Be like a servant wait for the master to arrive.

Not all pain/suffering is unavoidable.
