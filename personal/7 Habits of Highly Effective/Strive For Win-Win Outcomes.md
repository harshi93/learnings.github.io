Most situation in life doesn't have to be win-loose because most of the times there is enough pie for everyone to share 

When two people with win-loose mentality come together the outcomes are usually loose-loose and the dog ends up getting the pie 

In order to have positive relationship filled with trust in the long term, It is important to keep negotiating and communicating with the goal of finding a path that offers win-win outcomes for both parties even though this requires significant amount of patience and sensitivity.

In relationships

- Always be courteous 
- Try to understand what is important to other people (this really helps build strong relationship)
- Always be emphathetic and sensitive (as much as possible)
- Maintain Integrity (By not bad mouthing someone who is absent and by sharing what has been told to you in confidence)
- Be explicit of expectations.
