Leadership is first creation, and deals with primary concern what are things I want to accomplish

Management is second creation, it's a bottom line focus how can I best accomplish something


Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things
               - Peter Grucker and Warren Menis


Management is efficiently climbing the ladder of success, Leadership is ensuring ladder is leaning against the right wall 

Envision group of producers making their way through the jungle, these are problem solvers.
Managers are behind them sharpening machetes, writing policy and procedure manuals

Leader is the one who sits on top of tree looks around and decides whether we are heading towards our goal or not

Effective leadership is critical in today's world where managers and producers are busy cutting down undergrowth

In every aspect of independent and interdependent lives we are more in need of vision, destination or set of compass, a set of principles and directions, and less in need of a roadmap

Effectiveness or survival does not depend how we expand our efforts but rather on whether we expand our efforts in the right jungle.

The transformation taking place across organization demands leadership first and management second

Proactive powerful leadership must constantly monitor environment change and provide necessary force to organize resources in right direction.

If industries do not monitor environment including their work teams and excercise creative leadership to keep headed in right direction no amount of management expertise can keep them from failing

No management success can compensate for failure in leadership

As a parent do you want to lead the family or do you want to manage family?

Do you want to control where I am headed in life ?

Do you want to control what I do and how I do things?

Leadership is lacking in family/personal life as we are more into managing, efficiency, rules before we have even clarified our values rather than focussing on establishing/discussing purpose/family feeling/direction.
