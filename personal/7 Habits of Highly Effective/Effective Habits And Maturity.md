# Habits
Habits are intersection of knowledge skill and desire.

# Effectiveness
Effectiveness lies in the PPC balance where 
P stands for Production of desired results
PC stands for ability/asset to produce desired result

Think of story of golden goose and farmer 
The egg is the production
The golden goose is the production capacity

Father or daughter is an asset 
Their relationship is a golden goose

Exploiting/threatening/beating/manipulating someone weaker/younger than you may get you immediate result but it will poison the long-term relationship

Too much submission to will also lead to poisoning the long-term relationship

No one can persuade another to change, each one of us guard a gate of change that can only be opened from inside out. It cannot be opened by argument or emotional appeal.
