You create anything for first time in your mind and for second time when you implement it 

Carpenters Rule says measure twice cut once

It's really important that you think through what you have in your mind mirrors what you actually want

For example when you have blueprint in mind or hand you begin with your day by looking at the blueprint and setting goals for the day to decide what you want to be done with at the end of the day in other words you begin with end in mind
