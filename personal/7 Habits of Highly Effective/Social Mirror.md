If the only vision of ourselves comes from the social perception our reflection of ourself would be like crazy mirror image from mirrors in the carnival room, you might hear things like 

You are never on time 

You must be an artist

Why can't you be on time

Why can't you keep things in order

You eat like a horse

I can't believe won

This is so simple why can't you understand


Note: These are often times projections and reflections projecting the concerns or character weaknesses of people giving the input rather than accurately reflecting what we are


Because we are largely determined by conditioning and conditions


Theories of Determinism:

There are three theories of determinism widely accepted to determine the nature of man 


Genetic determinism:

Your grandparents did it to you (for example: short temperament being in DNA)


Psychic determinism 

Your parents did it to you, it's because the way you have been brought up that laid out your personal tenancies and character structure

It could be the reason why one is afraid to be up in front of the group

You feel guilty to make mistakes, you remember emotional punishments, the rejections, comparison with somebody else when you don't perfrom as well as expected


Environmental determinism:

It basically implies a member of your society ( your boss, your spouse, your government ) is responsible for your situation


Each of these maps are based on outcomes from stimulus response theory that involves pavlogs experiments with dogs.
