What lies behind us, what lies ahead of us are tiny matter compared to what lies within us 
- oliver wendell holmes


When I look upon tombs of the great every emotion of envy dies in me 
When I read the epitexts of the beautiful every inordinate desire goes out 
When I meet grief of parents upon tombstone my heart melts with compassion 
When I see tomb of parent themselves 
I quickly consider vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow
When I see kings lying beside those who deposed them
When I consider rival wits play side by side 
Or the holy men that divided the world with their contest and disputes
I reflect with sorrow and astonishments on the little competition, factions and debates of mankind
When I read several dates of the tombs
Of some that died yesterday and some that died years ago 
I consider that great day when all of us will be contemporary and make our appearance together 
               - Joseph addison
