More freedom means having the power to do anything from the limited set of things you have 


Between what has happened to us and the response we have the freedom to choose, meaning we can either choose to carry forward what has happened to us or we can change our response towards somebody else actions that mirror exact same thing or similar thing that happened to us. In those options lies our growth or happiness
