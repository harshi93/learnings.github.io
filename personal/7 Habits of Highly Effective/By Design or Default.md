If we do not develop our Self-Awareness and accept the responsibility for first creation we empower other people and circumstances outside our circle of influence to shape much of our lives by default.

We reactively live the scripts handed to us by families/associate/other people agendas/circumstantial pressures/scripts from earlier years/scripts from our training or conditioning.

These scripts come from people and not principles, these rise off our deep vulnerability or deep dependency on others and our need for acceptance/love/sense of belonging/sense of importance and worth/for a feeling that we matter 

Whether we are in control of it or not, whether we are aware or not, there is a first creation to all parts of our lives. 

We are either second creation of our own proactive design or we are second creation of other people's agendas/ circumstances/ past habits.

The unique human capacity of Self-Awareness/ imagination/conscience enable us to examine our first creation and make it possible for us to take charge of our own first creation, to write our own script.

In other words, Habit-1: says you are the creator  and Habit-2: is the first creation
