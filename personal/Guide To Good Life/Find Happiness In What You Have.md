Psychologists Shane Frederick and George Loewenstein call this phenomenon hedonic adaption, and it follows a typical progression: You lust after a new possession, such as a wide-screen TV or a flashy handbag. You buy it and enjoy it for a short while, but soon your new item starts to bore you.

The Stoics would advise you to stop taking the things you have for granted, and to instead learn to appreciate them. Rather than yearning for more and more new things, train yourself to want the things you already have.

the Stoics developed methods to help one appreciate the things and people in oneâ€™s environment. One such method is called negative visualization. imagine that the things and people you take for granted, like family or close friends, suddenly vanish. The feeling of loss is awful, but this exercise gives you a chance to ponder how lucky you are to still have them around you in reality.

Take this opportunity to feel happier and more appreciative of the possessions and people around you. Learning to appreciate what you have will help you enjoy the world in a much more profound way.
