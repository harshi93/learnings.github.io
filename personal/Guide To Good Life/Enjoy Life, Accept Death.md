If we contemplate the death of others, we can protect against the shock of their death. In a sense, this visualization prepares us for it.


Negative visualization, encourages us to become more appreciative of those close to us and to treat them better. If we are kind to them while they’re still alive, we won’t regret how we treated them when they pass away.

In addition to negative visualization, we can use reason to soothe our grief. We could take the view that the person we lost wouldn't want us to be tormented and depressed, but would prefer us to be grateful for the time we spent together and to cherish all our pleasant memories of them.

Old age forces us to contemplate death more carefully. In youth, death is distant and in a sense we live under the illusion that we are immortal. Thus, the youthful take some of their days for granted and maybe even find life boring at times. If that were the case for you, a Stoic would say you should learn to cherish your life.
