Good start is practicing negative visualization; this will get you used to the idea of being without the things and people that you value

Take note of the things in your life that are beyond your control and try to accept them. 

Make yourself aware of the things you have some  – but not all – control over. Notice them, think of how you can internalize your goals related to them, like in the example of the tennis match earlier. 

Remember, instead of aiming to win the match, make the goal to do your best.

Try not to project negatively onto other people. Keep in mind that everyone has their faults!
