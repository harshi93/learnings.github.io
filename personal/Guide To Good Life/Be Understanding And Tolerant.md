To be more tolerant of others’ behavior, we should remember that we all have faults. 
- The best we can do is aim for understanding and tolerance.

Another thing we can't control is other people's opinion of us. 
- No matter how much effort we put in, some people will find a flaw in what we do and form a negative opinion. Knowing this, it’s best to stop seeking the approval of others and practice indifference toward their opinion.

Striving to obtain other people's admiration means granting them power over us, because we’re forced to do things that will hold us in their favor. 
- By the same token, we surrender the things that could make them dislike us, even if these things mean a lot to us.

Seeking the admiration of others also means having to adapt to other people's ideas of success.
