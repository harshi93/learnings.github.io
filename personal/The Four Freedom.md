Don't use your word against yourself as it is sinful.

Understand your words aren't just words they are tool that have the power to communicate, express and transform.

Understand, anything  people say or do to you is not about you. It's actually about them, their beliefs, opinions and issues. 

Understand, people can have their perspective, opinion and so can you.

When you know or believe something or yourself don't seek permission of others or acceptance.

Instead of making assumptions, ask questions.

Do your best, understand your best varies, if so don't blame/judge yourself.

Understand, You don't have to be tied beliefs you had when were a child, as you are no child anymore, you are free to have your opinion and beliefs aside from what was taught.

Practice forgiveness, forgive yourself and others to be free from chains of negative emotions that keep you held back.

Free yourself to live as if each day is last day.
