# Conversation, Feedback and Recognition 

Involve conversations where real-time feedback and recognition go both ways.

CFRs allow leaders and contributors to sit down and discuss vital topics. 
    - Is the objective you’re working toward realistic ? 
    - Is it even the right objective to be working on ? 
    - And is it motivating ?

Having teams of contributors working toward common goals 
    – coupled with transparent communication and individual accountability 
    – should be a clear way to increase an organization’s performance.

Organizations that treat their employees as partners, not subordinates, tend to be the most successful.

Objectives and key results (OKRs) are a revolutionary tool that can help organizations reimagine their approach to management. 

OKRs allow organizations, and teams within them
    - To continuously set, track and achieve goals in a transparent and accountable way. 
    - And combined with regularly having conversations with employees about their performance 
    - Every week instead of once per year 
    – To bring a healthy and high-performance workplace culture.

When it comes to setting organizational objectives, remember that `less is more`.


Google cofounder Larry Page says, *“Put more wood behind fewer arrows.”* And Steve Jobs said , *“Innovation means saying no to one thousand things.”*

When it comes to setting your organizational objectives, 
    - you should only have between three and five per quarter. 

That way, you’ll be forced to figure out which priorities matter most to your organization before you begin working on them, and this will ensure that they’ll contribute to your future success.
