There should only be a handful of organization-wide OKRs at any one time, 

Everyone from top management to lower-level employees can stay focused on achieving a limited number of important goals – together.

Once top-level objectives has been finalized, between 3-5 KRs are needed per objective to help everyone at the company know when each objective has been reached. 

It's important to have clear time frame, so that departments across the organization can stay focused on collectively meeting deadlines. 

Revisit what OKRs have/have not been achieved, to determine if you need to build upon existing progress – or set a new course.
