# OKR Goals
Writing down a goal raises the chances of your reaching it.

A California study showed that friends who both wrote down their goals and shared their progress with friends on a weekly basis were 43 percent more likely to achieve their objectives.

# OKR Lifecycle
At any time in the quarterly OKR life cycle – four options are available to OKR contributors: continue, update, start and stop.

1. If an objective is on track, it makes sense to continue it. 
        - However, if external conditions have made key results unobtainable, then it’s best to update them to meet new realities.

2. At times It might even be necessary to start a new OKR in the middle of the quarter. 
        - And, sadly, unsuccessful OKRs sometimes need to be put to rest, which means stopping it mid-cycle.

# Track Goals Google Way
Google uses **0 to 1.0** color-coded scale 
    - It enable OKR contributors to assess how successfully they’ve completed key results. 
    - If it reads **0.0 to 0.3 (red)** means no progress has been made. 
    - If it reads **0.4 to 0.6 (yellow)** means progress has been made, but key results remain unmet. 
    - If it reads **And finally, 0.7-1.0 (green)** is a sign of the key result having been successfully attained.
