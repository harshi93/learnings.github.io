The brain can be trained like any other muscle: if we want a growth mindset, we can teach ourselves to think that way one step at a time.


Working towards a growth mindset presents a great opportunity to reach out to others for support, to talk about our faults and mistakes, and to make viable, concrete plans for achieving our goals.

It is important to understand that a fixed mindset is not easy to kick. It has likely become an emotional crutch over the years: it protects us from failure, creates recognition in the eyes of our parents and partners, and boosts our self-confidence. It comforts us time and again, so getting rid of it can be extremely discomforting.

it is not necessary to give up a fixed mindset altogether. As long as we adopt the growth perspective in certain situations, itâ€™s usually enough

Adopting a growth mindset in any field enables us to make the impossible possible and to continue improving our talents and abilities

Anyone can adopt a growth mindset and make the impossible possible.
