Mindset development begins at birth. Babies come into the world with a growth mindset: they want to learn and grow as much as possible each day.

adults in a child’s environment play a huge role in determining whether the child maintains this desire to grow or eventually adopts a fixed mindset

Parents with growth mindset encourage their children and urge them to continue learning, whereas those with a fixed mindset are always judging their children, telling them what is right or wrong, good or bad.

Growth-mindset babies will try to help another baby who is crying; fixed-mindset babies, by contrast, are annoyed by it.

Fixed mindset Teachers who believe that a student’s performance is unchangeable that good students will continue to do well and weaker students will always get Cs or Ds. Will push weaker students to develop a fixed mindset as a result.

Growth mindset teachers show their students different ways of solving math problems or understanding Shakespeare. Thus causing weaker students embrace a growth mindset and start getting better grades.

Our mindset is not entirely predetermined. It can change as early as childhood when we adopt the mindsets of our role models.

Our mindset is often strongly influenced by the role models we had as children.
