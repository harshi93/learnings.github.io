# Flow

A state of enjoyment and concentration so deep it blocks out all other concerns – even time itself.

When setting out to experience a state of flow, calibrating the level of difficulty is essential. 

After all, 
    - if you choose a task that’s too easy, you’ll get bored and distracted, hindering you from attaining flow and,
    - if your activity is too hard, you’ll struggle, get stressed out and eventually give up.
