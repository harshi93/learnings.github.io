Secret to longevity 


may boil down to just one word: ikigai, 

Ikigai, roughly translates to your reason for living – or your inner motivation for a specific professional activity.

Ikigai is intersection of 4 elements 
    - what you’re passionate about, 
    - where your skills lie, 
    - how you can earn a living and 
    - what the world needs. 

Many Japanese believe that everyone has an ikigai, or destiny, that they were born to fulfill.

Finding your purpose helps prevent problems like heart diseases and dementia
