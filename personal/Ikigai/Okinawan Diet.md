# Okinawan Diet
The Okinawan diet contains an incredible variety of foods. 

Locals eat up to 206 different foods on a regular basis, including a number of herbs and spices. For instance, every day, they eat five separate portions of fruits and vegetables. 

Okinawans suggests one should stop eating when you’re around 80 percent full; in other words, you should remain a little bit hungry.

There’s even a word for this concept in Japanese. It’s called `harahachibu`, 

Simple ways to achieve it include avoiding dessert or reducing portion size

Okinawans serve their food 
    - On small plates, 
    - With portions of rice, vegetables, miso soup and 
    - A small snack, such as edamame beans.

By eating fewer calories, 
    1. You can limit the level of a protein known as insulin-like growth factor 
    2. When too much of this protein exists in the body, cells age faster. 

Eating less directly correlates to a longer life.
