# Sitting Adversely Impacts Your Health.

According to health expert Gavin Bradley, 

Just a 30 mins sitting in a chair, the metabolism slows down, disrupting the healthy digestion of fat. 

Sitting for over 2 hours causes good cholesterol levels to drop.

Good news is that getting up for a mere 5 minutes every 30 mins is sufficient to offset these effects; 

Okinawans also partake in a more concerted form of exercise. It’s called Radio Taiso, 
    - a basic warm-up common for Okinawans and Japanese natives in general.

It’s practiced in the morning or throughout the day, often in large groups. 

Certain Okinawan schools, businesses and old age homes gather as a community to do these exercises every morning.
