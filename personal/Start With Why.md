No one buys into an idea, unless they understand why it exists 

People do their best work when they understand why they are doing, as a consequence financial gain is just an added advantage

Success is a fruit of design and not short-term patches

Make things fit by design not by default (don't fix things after they have been created, create them right in the first place)

Manipulation might be able to drive transaction but it doesn't breed loyalty

Law of diffusion, a theory defined by evertt m rogers that suggests every population can be divided into 5 segments:
	1 .The innovators (2.5%) 
	2. Early adopters (13.5%), 
	3. The early/late majority (65%) and 
	4. the laggards (16%).

The innovators and the early adopters are your loyalists, you need to make sure they understand and see the value of your product, then the early/late majority and laggards will catch up eventually 

Teams focussed on what often fail, while the ones focussed on why succeed extraordinarily

Hire people for what they can do for you, they will work for your money.

Hire people who believe in your why, they will give you their blood, sweat and tears
