In this century of constant technological and political upheaval, we can prepare ourselves for the future 

by acknowledging our own ignorance in the face of increasing complexity, and discussing hot political topics, such as immigration, with calm rationality. 

We can also futureproof ourselves by learning to tell the difference between real and fake news. 

Although the twenty-first century has brought fears of terrorism and mass unemployment, we should remember that, ultimately, the key to our prosperity and security remains in our own hands.

Actionable advice:

Truth doesn’t speak to power, staying on the periphery of power can teach you a lot rather than being on it's center

It’s easy to assume that powerful leaders always have the inside track on situations, or know the truth about what other people think. But the reality is that great leaders are often less well informed than the average person. Why? Because, as people become more and more powerful, those around them become equally less likely to divulge hard hitting truths to them. Instead, people around these leaders become more concerned with flattering them, and ensuring they don’t say anything inappropriate or confusing during the short time they have their ear. Therefore, if you want the truth, try hanging around on the periphery of power, rather than at its centre. You just might learn something.
