New discoveries in the field of neuroscience are enabling computers to take our jobs.

While optimists point to the time when industrial revolution was getting started and there was a widespread fear that more people will loose their job but nothing of such sort happened rather the for each job lost a new job was created.

A good reason to believe such a revolution would be more destructive in 21st century is backed by the fact that previous industrial revolution only replaced jobs requiring physical abilities and created a new one to operate those physical machine replacing the old jobs. 

Due to recent development to program /train machines to leverage human like cognitive abilities next industrial revolution would lead to machines replacing humans completely.

Also neuroscientists have found out that human intuition which was until now considered backbone of human decision making abilities is not actually the reason why/what/how humans make decision but rather it's the ability of neural network inside human brain to calculate probabilities and identify familiar patterns in split second.

In other words, in the years ahead, even the most cognitively demanding jobs wonâ€™t be safe from automation.
