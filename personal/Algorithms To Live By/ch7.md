# Bell curve distribution:

For instance, there’s the famous “bell curve,” modeled on a normal distribution, which applies to many phenomena. When predicting the average age of a random group of people, you can assume that few people are extremely young or extremely old; most fall somewhere in the middle of the bell. This way, if you’re going on a blind date, you can be reasonably sure you won’t be dining with a nonagenarian.

# Power law distribution:
the power-law-distribution, suggests we reach the median average by having most observations falling below it and only a few enormous ones falling above it. 
- An excellent example of this is wealth distribution. Generally speaking, there are many poor people and only a select few that own the lion’s share of the world’s wealth.
