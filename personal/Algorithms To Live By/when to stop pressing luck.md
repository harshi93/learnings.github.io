# Algorithms can tell when to stop pressing our luck

Our judgment is often clouded by the first thing that comes along, which we tend to perceive as the best option available. 


# Optimal stopping: 
Look at 37 (the algorithms suggests to review 37%) to establish standard,  then jump on the first option that meets the standard devised as outcome of reviewing 37 apartments options.if there are 100 options, optimal stopping says to look at the first 37 without taking any of them. Instead, look at them to establish a standard, such as excluding apartments that are on the ground floor and have small bathrooms.

Then, after the first 37, you should jump on the first one that meets these standards. While this strategy doesn’t guarantee that you’ll end up with the best, these optimal odds are far better than just making a guess.

And it doesn’t just apply to apartments; whether you’re looking for a car, a job or a potential mate, the magic number is always 37 percent
