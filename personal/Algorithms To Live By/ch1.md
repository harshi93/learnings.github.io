The word actually dates back to the ninth century, when it was first used by the Persian mathematician Muhammad al-Khwarizmi. 

But the use of algorithms can be traced roughly four thousand years back, to the Sumerian civilization.

Simply put, an algorithm is a finite series of steps that help solve a problem – and it’s a technique we use all the time.

By their very nature, the intuitive algorithms that humans use aren’t precise. We use them in times of uncertainty to make the best decision we can, like weighing the potential benefits against the risks of jumping into a new business investment.

intuitive algorithms may seem rather subjective and random compared to the mathematical algorithms a computer uses, though they basically provide the same solution.
