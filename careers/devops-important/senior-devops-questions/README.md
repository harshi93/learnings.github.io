# Critical Questions for Senior DevOps Engineers

This document outlines essential questions that senior DevOps engineers should ask during various operational scenarios. Asking the right questions demonstrates domain ownership, technical authority, and a methodical approach to problem-solving.

## Daily Support Questions

1. **System Health Assessment**: "What metrics or indicators show deviation from normal patterns, and when did they start changing?"
   - Helps identify the scope and timeline of issues quickly
   - Establishes baseline behavior versus anomalies
   - Shows domain ownership by focusing on metrics first

2. **Recent Change Detection**: "What was the last change made to the system, and has it been verified in all environments?"
   - Often reveals the root cause of new issues
   - Validates deployment consistency across environments
   - Demonstrates understanding of change management principles

3. **Impact Evaluation**: "Which users or services are affected, and what's the business impact?"
   - Helps prioritize response based on business criticality
   - Shows awareness of service dependencies
   - Frames technical issues in business terms for stakeholders

4. **Communication Verification**: "Who needs to be informed about this issue, and has communication been initiated?"
   - Ensures proper stakeholder management
   - Prevents duplicate work across teams
   - Demonstrates commanding voice and leadership

5. **Resource Adequacy**: "Do we have sufficient resources (people, tools, access) to address this issue, or do we need to escalate?"
   - Identifies potential bottlenecks in resolution
   - Shows team awareness and coordination skills
   - Demonstrates authority to make escalation decisions

## Proof of Concept Questions

1. **Purpose Clarification**: "What specific problem are we trying to solve, and how will we measure success?"
   - Ensures alignment on objectives
   - Establishes clear evaluation criteria
   - Shows business outcome focus

2. **Architecture Compatibility**: "How does this solution integrate with our existing architecture and systems?"
   - Prevents isolated technology decisions
   - Evaluates technical debt implications
   - Demonstrates systems thinking

3. **Scaling Consideration**: "How will this solution scale with our projected growth, and what are the limitations?"
   - Tests solution viability beyond initial implementation
   - Addresses future-proofing concerns
   - Shows strategic thinking and domain ownership

4. **Security and Compliance**: "What security considerations need to be addressed, and does this meet our compliance requirements?"
   - Ensures security isn't an afterthought
   - Validates regulatory compatibility
   - Demonstrates security-first mindset

5. **Operational Readiness**: "What operational overhead will this solution create, and how will we support it?"
   - Addresses monitoring, alerting, and runbook needs
   - Considers on-call and troubleshooting implications
   - Shows lifecycle thinking beyond implementation

## Troubleshooting Questions

1. **Symptom Characterization**: "What are the exact symptoms, and can we reproduce them consistently?"
   - Distinguishes between intermittent and consistent issues
   - Helps isolate variables in complex systems
   - Demonstrates methodical approach to problem-solving

2. **Timeline Mapping**: "When did the issue first appear, and what changes coincided with its onset?"
   - Establishes causality vs. correlation
   - Creates a timeline for investigation
   - Shows systematic investigation technique

3. **Environment Comparison**: "Does this issue occur in all environments, or only specific ones?"
   - Identifies environmental variables
   - Narrows search space for root cause
   - Shows understanding of configuration drift issues

4. **Component Isolation**: "Can we isolate which component or service is failing, and what downstream effects are occurring?"
   - Breaks complex problems into manageable parts
   - Maps dependency chains in distributed systems
   - Demonstrates systems architecture knowledge

5. **Log and Metric Analysis**: "What do the logs, metrics, and traces tell us about the system's behavior during the failure?"
   - Utilizes observability tools effectively
   - Focuses on data-driven troubleshooting
   - Shows proficiency with monitoring systems

## Root Cause Analysis Questions

1. **Failure Mechanism**: "What specifically failed, and why did our existing safeguards not prevent or catch it?"
   - Identifies both the failure and control gaps
   - Addresses multiple layers of defense
   - Shows systems resilience thinking

2. **Contributing Factors**: "What environmental, configuration, or operational factors contributed to this issue?"
   - Looks beyond immediate technical cause
   - Considers human and process factors
   - Shows holistic problem analysis

3. **Detection Improvement**: "How could we have detected this issue earlier, and what indicators were missed?"
   - Focuses on improving observability
   - Addresses monitoring gaps
   - Shows proactive mindset

4. **Prevention Strategy**: "What specific changes would prevent this class of issues from recurring?"
   - Moves beyond fixing symptoms to addressing causes
   - Generalizes solutions for broader application
   - Shows strategic improvement thinking

5. **Knowledge Capture**: "How will we document and share what we've learned to improve our collective knowledge?"
   - Ensures lessons are institutionalized
   - Prevents recurring issues
   - Demonstrates commitment to team growth and knowledge sharing
