# Laws of Growth
- Good Character is priceless
- Someone criticising = someone invested in your growth
- Don't think to get credit to satisfy critcism
- We decide what we do with criticism

# Criticism 
- Is a gift
- Is not rejection
- Is for you to grow
- Is not court order
- Is opinion of people
- Should be used as a basis of improvement
- Should not be tied to self worth
- When received don't shutdown or be defensive
- Helps you see the blind spots

# Understand Feedback
- Understand Intention
- Ask for specific examples
- Person giving feedback may have data/experience, you don't

# Responding to Feedback
There is a 3 step framework to responding to feedback
> - Receive = Understand/Ask for clarification with example
> - Reflect = requires asking, can you relate to it, does it negatively affect in long-term impact, should you act on the feedback
> - Response = try to change according to feedback, but if you have tried and can't still change, notify the person giving feedback

# Don't Forget
- Highlight your worth to business
- State your contributions, ask for raise
- Establish a cut-off period in your mind, if no actions on request, probably time to re-think your position.
