| **Dataset is all integers and can fit in memory**  | **Binary Search** (if sorted), **Linear Search** (if unsorted), or **Hashing**                                                                                                                                                                   | If the dataset is sorted, **Binary Search** is the most efficient with \(O(\log n)\) complexity. For unsorted data, **Linear Search** is simple but slower (\(O(n)\)). **Hashing** enables \(O(1)\) lookups for key-value pairs.       |
| **Dataset is all integers and cannot fit in memory** | **External Binary Search**, **B-Tree Search**, or **Index-Based Search**                                                                                                                                                                         | For large datasets, **External Binary Search** divides the data into chunks and processes them sequentially. **B-Trees** are efficient for disk-based searches, as they minimize disk I/O operations. Indexing can also speed up searches.     |

If the dataset is sorted alphabetically, **Binary Search** works well. For unsorted data, **Linear Search** is a fallback.                                       |

### Key Notes:
1. **Binary Search**: Best for sorted datasets and has \(O(\log n)\) complexity.
2. **Linear Search**: Simple and works for unsorted datasets but has \(O(n)\) complexity.
3. **Trie-Based Search**: Ideal for alphabetic data or strings, especially for prefix-based searches.
4. **Hashing**: Provides \(O(1)\) lookups for key-value pairs, making it efficient for in-memory searches.
5. **External Search**: For datasets that cannot fit in memory, algorithms like **B-Trees**, **External Binary Search**, and **External Tries** are efficient as they minimize disk I/O operations.
