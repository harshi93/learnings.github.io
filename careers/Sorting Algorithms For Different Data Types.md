| **Dataset is all integers and can fit in memory**  | **Counting Sort**, **Radix Sort**, or **Quick Sort**                                                                                                                                                                                      | Counting Sort and Radix Sort are highly efficient for integers due to their non-comparative nature. Quick Sort is also a good choice for general-purpose in-memory sorting with \(O(n \log n)\) average complexity.                                |
| **Dataset is all integers and cannot fit in memory** | **External Merge Sort**, **Heap Sort (external)**                                                                                                                                                                                         | For large datasets that don’t fit in memory, **External Merge Sort** is ideal as it divides data into chunks, sorts them in memory, and merges them. Heap Sort can also be adapted for external sorting by using disk-based heaps.                  |
| **Dataset is all alphabet and can fit in memory**  | **Radix Sort (for strings)**, **Quick Sort**, or **Merge Sort**                                                                                                                                                                           | Radix Sort works well for sorting strings alphabetically by processing character by character. Quick Sort and Merge Sort are also efficient for in-memory sorting of strings.                                                                       |
| **Dataset is all alphabet and cannot fit in memory** | **External Merge Sort**, **Trie-Based Sorting**                                                                                                                                                                                           | External Merge Sort is suitable for large datasets that don’t fit in memory. Trie-based sorting can also be used for alphabetic data, as it organizes strings efficiently in a tree structure for external processing.                             |
| **Dataset is a mix of integers and alphabets and can fit in memory** | **Custom Comparator with Quick Sort or Merge Sort**, **Radix Sort (if separable)**                                                                                                                                                         | Use a **custom comparator** with Quick Sort or Merge Sort to handle mixed data types. If integers and alphabets can be separated, Radix Sort can be applied to integers and a string sorting algorithm to the alphabetic part.                     |
| **Dataset is a mix of integers and alphabets and cannot fit in memory** | **External Merge Sort with Custom Comparator**, **Bucket Sort (external)**                                                                                                                                                                | External Merge Sort with a custom comparator can handle mixed data types efficiently. Bucket Sort can also be adapted for external sorting by dividing data into buckets and processing them sequentially.                                           |

### Key Notes:
1. **In-Memory Sorting**: When the dataset fits in memory, algorithms like **Counting Sort**, **Radix Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Merge Sort** are efficient and widely used.
2. **External Sorting**: For datasets that don’t fit in memory, **External Merge Sort** is the most common choice as it processes data in chunks and merges them efficiently. Disk-based adaptations of algorithms like **Heap Sort** or **Bucket Sort** are also useful.
3. **Mixed Data**: For mixed datasets, **custom comparators** or separating integers and alphabets for independent sorting can simplify the process.
4. **Radix Sort**: Works well for both integers and strings when the data can be processed digit by digit or character by character.
