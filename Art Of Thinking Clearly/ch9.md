We like others if they are attractive, flatter us or remind us of ourselves.

a single quality – whether beauty, social status, age, etc. – produces in us a positive or negative impression that outshines everything else. This is called the halo effect.

we generally fall prey to the liking bias – i.e., liking people when they are similar to us and if they like us.

Feelings guide our decisions more than we think.

the markets aren’t untouched by emotional influence. In fact, one study found that daily market performance in 26 major stock exchanges was influenced by the amount of morning sun: when the sun shone first thing, the stock market rose during the day, thus indicating that the positive emotions triggered by sunshine influenced the flow of billions of dollars.
